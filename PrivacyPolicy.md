### Privacy Policy

We don't collect or track your data, period.

We physically can't. The Cookie Bus uses the local storage to store the profiles and the cookies are copied to the chrome browser. All actions are happening locally on the user's machine. On top of it, Cookie Bus is an open-source project in which all code is transparent to the user.
